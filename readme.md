# Sillymap

Sillymap is my own personal implementation of some computer vision algorithms. The end goal is to understand the entire SfM (Structure from Motion) pipeline by implementing it from scratch.

Currently, I have only implemented a small part of the SWIFT algorithm for feature detection. More to follow!

It's called sillymap because it would be silly to use it for anything serious.

## GenAI

The goal of this project for me is to learn, so I am using GenAI tools only when I think they would be helpful for that goal. This includes debugging issues I am stuck on and frustrated with (as these reduce motivation), and helping in validating my understanding of concepts. Additionally, I have used them to find relevant terms and references, as I am very new to this field.
I have not used GenAI to write any code that I do not fully understand myself in this project.
